# Experiment with Apache Spark and Chess Data

I've read this post by Adam Drake: [Command-line tools can be 235x faster than your Hadoop cluster](http://aadrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html).

I was curious to see how [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) could perform in this case and made this experiment.
